#PART 17:  TEST ENDPOINTS
---
###17.0: API Documentation
1. Make sure there are some notes in the database for your specific user, if not add some
2. Take a look at the data and make note of the `NoteId`'s of the user's notes and the next available Id#
3. Run the API
4. Add **/help** to the URL to see the API docs with the newly constructed endpoints that were auto-generated from the API Controller methods

It's important to learn how to use this documentation.  If you were to have a more focused career in front-end development, you would need to be able to use these endpoints as an access point into your application database.  If you are a back-end developer, you will need to read these endpoints to test your API before it's live to all.  Notice that the documentation matches the parameters of your APIController methods. 

[Next,](17.1-GetByIdTest.md) we'll test the `GetNoteById` method.
