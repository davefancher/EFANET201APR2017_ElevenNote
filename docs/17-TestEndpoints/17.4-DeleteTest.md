# 17.4: TESTING `Delete`
---
### Test the `Delete` Method
1. You can keep the same URL
2. Change the verb to **DELETE**
3. Press **Send** and you should get **200 OK**

4. To make sure the note was deleted, change **DELETE** to **GET** and take the /id off the end of the URL so it's just **api/Note**
5. Press **Send** and make sure the note is no longer there

6. You can close Postman

[Next,](/18-Swagger/18.0-SwaggerSetup.md) we'll use a different tool, Swagger, to test the endpoints.
