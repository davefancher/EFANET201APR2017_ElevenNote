#17.2: TESTING `Post`
---
###Test the `Post` Method
1. Change the URL to **api/Note**
2. Change **Get** to **Post**
3. In order to test that data will post, we need to add data in the Body of our request
4. Click on the **Body** tab and check **urlencoded**
5. Enter in the Keys and Values as below
   * Make sure to use a `NoteId` that isn't already being used in your database

6. Press **Send** and you should get a success
7. Test that this worked by running a **Get** request with the end of the URL **api/Note/X**
   * X is the `NoteId` you used
8. You should see your note in the response
