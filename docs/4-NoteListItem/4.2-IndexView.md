#4.2: Index View
---
###Create the Index View
1. Go to the **Note Controller**
2. Right click on the `Index()` method
3. Select **Add View**
![Add View](/assets/4.2-A.png)
4. Fill it out like this:
![View](/assets/4.2-B.png)
5. This creates a file in the views folder, but we won't see anything if we run the app since there is no data yet. 
6. Remember that the view created is based on the properties listed in the NoteListItem model, so if those change, you'll want to re-do this. 
7. We'll look at the view file later.

###Do something in the Note Controller
1. Add this code in the `Index()` method:
```cs
namespace ElevenNote.Web.Controllers
{
    public class NoteController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            var model = new NoteListItem[0];
            return View(model);
        }
    }
}
```
2. CTRL . to bring in the using statement for the `NoteListItem` model
3. Add the authorize annotation - explain
```cs
namespace ElevenNote.Web.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class NoteController : Controller
```
4. ![Save](/assets/font-awesome-save.png)
5. Run the app
6. Add '/note' to the end of the URL

7. If you are not logged in, you should be redirected to the Login page. This is due to the `[Authorize]` annotation we added.
