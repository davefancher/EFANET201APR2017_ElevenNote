---
###Create the Index View
1. In **ElevenNote.Web > Controllers** folder, open the **Note Controller**
2. Right click on the `Index()` method
3. Select **Add View**

4. Fill it out like this:
![View](/assets/4.2-B.png)

####Notes
- This creates a file in the views folder, but we won't see anything if we run the app since there is no data yet. 
- The view created is based on the properties listed in the `NoteListItem` model. If those change, you'll want to re-do this. 
- We'll look at the view file later.

###Do something in the Note Controller
1. Back in the **Note Controller**, add this code in the `Index()` method:

    ```cs
    namespace ElevenNote.Web.Controllers
    {
        public class NoteController : Controller
        {
            public ActionResult Index()
            {
                var model = new NoteListItem[0];
                return View(model);
            }
        }
    }
    ```
2. CTRL . to bring in the using statement for the `NoteListItem` model
3. Add the `[Authorize]` annotation to make this accessible only to logged in users

    ```cs
    namespace ElevenNote.Web.Controllers
    {
        [Authorize]
        public class NoteController : Controller
    ```
4. ![Save](/assets/font-awesome-save.png)
5. Run the app
6. Add '/note' to the end of the URL

7. If you are not logged in, you should be redirected to the Login page. This is due to the `[Authorize]` annotation we added.
