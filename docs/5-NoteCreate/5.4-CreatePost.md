# 5.4: CREATE `[HttpPost]` METHOD
---
### Add the Create `[HttpPost]` Method
In this section, we write an `[HttpPost]` method that will eventually push the data inputted in the view to the database.
1. Go to **ElevenNote.Web -> Controllers -> NoteController.cs**
2. Add the following code under the existing `Create()` method:
    ```cs
            public ActionResult Create()
            {
                return View();
            }
            
            [HttpPost]
            [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
            public ActionResult Create(NoteCreate model)
            {
                if (ModelState.IsValid)
                {

                }
                return View(model);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### QuickWatch and Data
1. Set a breakpoint at the spot noted in the image below:
![Set Breakpoint](/assets/5.4-A.png)
2. Run the app and login
3. Go to **Notes -> Create New** and create a note
4. You should hit the breakpoint and it should turn yellow:

5. Right click on `ModelState` and click **QuickWatch**

6. You can explore the data coming from the view
7. Re-run the app without the breakpoint and create a note
8. Go to **SQL Server Object Explorer**
9. Find the database and expand the tables
10. Right click on `dbo.Note` and click **View Data**
11. The data is not going into the database, we'll take care of that in the next section

[Next,](/6-NoteService/6.0-NoteService.md) we'll start on the `NoteService`.
