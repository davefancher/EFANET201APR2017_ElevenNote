# PART 5: `NoteCreate`
---
In this module we'll be setting up the Create Controller method.

<hr />

### 5.0: Create *GET* Method
This section creates a *GET* method that gives users a `View` in which they can fill in the `Title` and `Content` for a new note.

In the **Note Controller**, add a `Create()` method under the `Index()` method

    ```cs
        var model = new NoteListItem[0];
        return View(model);
    }
//Add method here VVVV
    // GET
    public ActionResult Create()
    {
        return View();
    }
    ```

Again, this is the *GET* method. We are making a request to get the Create View. This method will run and the app will break. Why?

Because we don't have a view, and we don't have a model for the view.
