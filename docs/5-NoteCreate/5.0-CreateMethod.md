# PART 5: `NoteCreate`
---
In this module we'll be setting up the Create view.

<hr />

### 5.0: Create *GET* Method
This section creates a *GET* method that gives users a `View` in which the can fill in the `Title` and `Content` for a new note.

1. In the **Note Controller**, add a `Create()` method under the `Index()` method

    ```cs
        var model = new NoteListItem[0];
        return View(model);
    }

    public ActionResult Create()
    {
        return View();
    }
    ```
2. ![Save](../assets/font-awesome-save.png)

This is the *GET* method, we'll add a *POST* method later. Unless specified, the default is *GET.*
