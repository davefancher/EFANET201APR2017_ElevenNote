# 5.1: `NoteCreate` MODEL
---
In this section, we'll create the `NoteCreate` model that allow us to have some validation for the note properties.

### Purpose
Think about the things we'll need to capture when we create a note and save it to the database. We need to create a Title, Content, and DateCreated. Will we provide an id though?

The answer is no. The id will be created after the POST request happens, after we fill out a form with the two properties above. So, we won't provide that. Our .Service and .Data layer will work together to take care of that. Let's talk about that again soon.

### NoteCreate model
1. Right click on **ElevenNote.Models**
2. Select **Add -> Class** and name it `NoteCreate.cs`
3. Make the class public.
4. Add the following properties (for the `ToString` method, you can type `override` and then a space):

```cs
namespace ElevenNote.Models
{
    public class NoteCreate
    {
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string Content { get; set; }

        public override string ToString()
        {
            return base.ToString();
        }
    }
}
```
5. Add the `[Required]` annotation to the `Title` property:

    ```cs
            [Required]
            public string Title { get; set; }
            public string Content { get; set; }
    ```
6. `CTRL .` to bring in the using statement
7. We can also add annotations to require or limit the number of characters in each field.
 
    ```cs
            [Required]
            [MinLength(2, ErrorMessage = "Please enter at least 2 characters.")]
            [MaxLength(100, ErrorMessage = "There are too many characters in this field.")]
            public string Title { get; set; }

            [MaxLength(8000)]
            public string Content { get; set; }    
    ```

8. [Next,](5.2-CreateView.md) we'll make the view for creating a note.
