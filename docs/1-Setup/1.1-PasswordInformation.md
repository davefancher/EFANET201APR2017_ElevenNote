# 1.1 PASSWORD INFORMATION
---
### Change Password Requirements
1. In the **Solution Explorer**, go to **App_Start > IdentityConfig.cs**
   - *If you do not see the **_Solution Explorer_** go to **_View > Solution Explorer_***
2. The `PasswordValidator` variable declaration is on line 54
3. Set the booleans to false and ![Save](/assets/font-awesome-save.png) the file (CTRL S)
   - This way you can use simpler passwords while developing
   - *Note, the required length is always at least 6*
