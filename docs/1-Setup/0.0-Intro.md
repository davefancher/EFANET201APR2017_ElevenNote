# PART 0: Intro
---
In this module we'll give an overview of an n-tier application.

<hr />

### n-tier
Here we'll be setting up the foundation for an n-tier application. In an n-tier application we attempt to establish a separation of concerns, where entity models, contracts, services layer, unit tests, and presentation will all have their separate layers. In our C# application, these layers are demarcated by assemblies and inside each assembly, our complexity for each layer will be encapsulated.

<hr />

### OVERVIEW OF THE APP'S STRUCTURE
As we separate our projects into various assemblies, we'll give an analysis of each layer. Here are a few notes for starting purposes:  

---
| **Layer** | **Purpose** |
|--:|:--|
| ElevenNote.Data | This is where we setup our database using Entity Framework |
| ElevenNote.Contracts | Houses interfaces for method signatures used in Unit Testing and the Service layer. |
| ElevenNote.Services | The messenger that helps the data and presentation tiers communicate. Examples of services include authentication and authorization |
| ElevenNote.Models | View Models represent the data that we want to show on the page. They are useful because you can pull specific properties from multiple tables |
| ElevenNote.WebMVC | This is the MVC part of the app and uses Razor to display our information. You might also see this referred to as the presentation tier. |
| ElevenNote.WebAPI | Web APIs provide us with logic that allows us to pass data to other presentation tiers - i.e. mobile, Angular, etc |
