# 1.2a: OVERVIEW OF THE APP'S STRUCTURE
---
| **Layer** | **Purpose** |
|--:|:--|
| Data | This is where we setup our database using Entity Framework |
| Services | The messenger that helps the data and presentation tiers communicate. Examples of services include authentication and authorization |
| View Models | These are the models for what we want to see in the view |
| Web | This is the MVC part of the app and uses Razor to display our information. You might also see this referred to as the presentation tier. |
| WebAPI | Web APIs provide us with logic that allows us to pass data to other presentation tiers - i.e. mobile, Angular, etc |
