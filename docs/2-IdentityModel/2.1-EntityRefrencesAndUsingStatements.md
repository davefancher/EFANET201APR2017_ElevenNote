# 2.1: ENTITY FRAMEWORK, REFERENCES, AND USING STATEMENTS
---
After moving `IdentityModels.cs` to **ElevenNote.Data** you should be seeing some errors. Don't freak out, this is normal. We just need to add a few things to the file.

### Add Entity Framework to the Projects
1. Right click on the solution and choose **Manage Nuget Packages for Solution**
2. Browse for **EntityFramework**
3. Choose **Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework**
4. Click **Project**
5. Click **Install**

6. Close the NuGet Package Manager

### Add References
1. `CTRL SHIFT B` to build the project
2. You should see a list of errors which may vary from the screenshot below

3. The web project needs to communicate with the other projects in our solution, this is done with references.
4. Right-click on **ElevenNote.Web** and go to **Add -> Reference**
5. Click on **Projects -> Solution**
6. Select each project and click **OK**

Click [here](2.1a-References.md) for additional information about references.

### Add Using Statements
Because we moved the `IdentityModels.cs` file from the Web project to the **Data** project, we need to bring in using statements for the Data project.
1. `CTRL SHIFT B` to build the project
2. You should still have errors - see below for an example
![Using Statement Errors](/assets/2.1-D.png)
3. Double click on the first error to go to the code with the error
4. Click on the error in the file and `CTRL .` to bring in the using statement
![CTRL .](/assets/2.1-E.png)
5. It should bring in the following using statement at the top of your file (your line #'s may differ)
![Using Statement](/assets/2.1-F.png)
6. `CTRL SHIFT B` again to build the project
   - `CTRL SHIFT B` saves everything first, and then builds a library for the project.
7. There should be more errors
8. Repeat the above process until all errors are gone

[Next,](2.2-IdentityModelsSetup.md) we'll add some code to the `IdentityModels.cs` file.
