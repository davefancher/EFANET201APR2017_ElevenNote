# 3.0a: DATA ANNOTATIONS
---
### Key Attribute
The `[key]` attribute specifies the property that **uniquely** identifies an entity.  In other words, it's the **primary key** of the corresponding database. 

### Key Attribute Example
```cs
public class Order
{
    [Key]
    public int OrderNumber { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateCreated { get; set; }
    public Customer Customer { get; set; }
}
```
A single customer could have multiple orders, or different customers could order at the same time, so we need some sort of property that returns a **unique** order number.

### Validation Attributes
There are a few attributes we can use to **validate** our models. The `[Required]` attribute ensures the user does not enter a **null** value.  The `[Range]` attribute ensures the user provides a value within the specified range. Attributes such as `[MaxLength]` limit the amount of characters users can provide.

### Validation Attribute Example
```cs
[Required]
[Range(1,5, ErrorMessage="please choose a number between 1 and 5")]
[MaxLength(100, ErrorMessage = "There are too many characters in this field.")]
```
### Display Attribute Examples:
```cs
[Display(Name = "Created")]
```
