---
* GUID: Globally Unique Identifier
* Global, as in the world
* Computer that this is running on is capable of generating
* Identity Framework identifies users by GUID
* It is a hexadecimal character
* Once user is created, it creates a GUID that is tied to the user's account
* Performance of the database, inserting a new row, we want something that is incremental
* It's faster to add something to the end of the list, not the middle
