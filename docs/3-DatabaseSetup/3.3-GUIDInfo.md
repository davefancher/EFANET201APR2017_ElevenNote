# 3.0c: GUIDs
---
In this module we'll talk a about GUIDs.

<hr />

Here is a bit of information on **GUIDs**. Bascially, we are creating unique, near impossible to replicate(like 1 in 1 trillion chance) IDs for our users.

## Notes:
* GUID stands for *Globally Unique IDentifier*
* GUIDs are ID numbers on steroids
* 32 digit hexadecimals grouped in chunks of 8-4-4-12
* There are about **10^38** possible GUIDs, you can pretty much guarantee they'll be unique.
* GUIDs can be used to identify users, urls, or just about anything. 
* The inherent randomness of GUIDs is good for security but bad for debugging because they are tough to access.
* GUIDs aren't perfect. There's still a very small chance that you can have duplicate GUIDs.
