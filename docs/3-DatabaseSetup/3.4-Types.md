# 3.4: TYPES AND `DateTimeOffset`
---
In this module we'll talk about Value Types, DateTimeOffset, and Reference Types.

<hr />

### Value Types Review
- `DateTimeOffset` is a **value** type, they *can't be null*.
- Adding the ? to `ModifiedUtc` allows a value type to be null.
- It's good to store dates with `DateTimeOffset`, this way it will account for time zones.
- We will format the date & time in [Part 11.](../11-DateFormat/11.0-DateFormat.md)

### Reference Types
Just for the sake of review let's note something important:
- Objects are **reference** types, they *can be null*.
- Reference Types point to an address in memory.

Just a little review.
