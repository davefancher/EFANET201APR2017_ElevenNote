###3.0b: Migrations
If you change the structure of your database, you will need to run migrations
1. In the Quick Launch (top left), type in **'Package Manager Console'**
- add image
2. Make sure to change the Default Project to **ElevenNote.Data**
- add image
   - This is easy to forget, so in a few weeks when you do this again and get an error, it's probably becasue your default project is set to **ElevenNote.Web**
3. Type **Enable-Migrations**
4. Type **Add-Migration** and then a space and a breif note about what the migration is (similar to a git commit message)
5. Type **Update-Database**
