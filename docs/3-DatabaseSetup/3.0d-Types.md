#3.0d: TYPES AND DateTimeOffset
---
- Objects are reference types, they can be null
- DateTimeOffset is a value type, they can't be null
- Adding the ? to ModifiedUtc allows a value type to be null
- It's good to store dates with DateTimeOffset, this way it will account for time zones.
- We will format the date & time in [Part 11.]()
