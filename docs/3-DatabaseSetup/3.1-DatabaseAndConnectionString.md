#3.1: Database and Connection String
---
###Connection String
1. In **ElevenNote.Web**, open the `Web.Config` file
2. Look at the `<connectionStrings>`
3. Notice the the name is `"DefaultConnection"`
- add image
4. Go to **ElevenNote.Data >** `IdentityModels.cs`
5. In the `ApplicationDbContext` method, one of the arguments is `"DefaultConnection"`
6. This is how the application can communicate with the configuration file and persist application data
7. Go back to **ElevenNote.Web >** `Web.Config`
8. In the connection string, the name of the database? is in two places, change both to remove the aspnet at the beginning and the numbers at the end (does it matter when this is done - should it be done sooner?)
- add image
9. Go the the **Solution Explorer**
10. Click on the Show all Files button until you see the .mdf file, this is the database?
