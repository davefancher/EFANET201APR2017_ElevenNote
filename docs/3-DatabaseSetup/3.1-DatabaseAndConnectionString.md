2. Look at the `<connectionStrings>`
3. Notice the the name is `"DefaultConnection"`

4. Go to **ElevenNote.Data >** `IdentityModels.cs`
5. In the `ApplicationDbContext` method, one of the arguments is `"DefaultConnection"`
6. This is how the application can communicate with the configuration file and persist application data
7. Go back to **ElevenNote.Web >** `Web.Config`
8. In the connection string, the name of the database? is in two places, change both to remove the aspnet at the beginning and the numbers at the end (does it matter when this is done - should it be done sooner?)
