# 3.4 Guids
---
In this module we'll talk about Guids.

<hr />

### Purpose
In our Note.cs class we create an OwnerId that was of type Guid. A Guid is a type that allows us to create unique, near impossible to replicate(like 1 in 1 trillion chance) IDs for our users or items for our users. 

#### Notes:
Here are a few things to note about Guids: 
* Guid stands for *Globally Unique IDentifier*
* Guids are 32 digit hexadecimals grouped in chunks of 8-4-4-12
* There are about **10^38** possible Guids, we can pretty much guarantee they'll be unique.
* Guids can be used to identify users, urls, or just about anything. 
* The inherent randomness of GUIDs is good for security but bad for debugging because they are tough to access.
* Guids aren't perfect. There's still a very small chance(one in one trillion chance) that you can have duplicate Guids.
