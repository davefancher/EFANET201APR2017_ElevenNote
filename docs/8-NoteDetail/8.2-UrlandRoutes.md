# 8.2 URL AND ROUTES DISCUSSION
---
In this section, we'll learn about `RouteConfig.cs` and how our URLs are made up.

### `RouteConfig.cs`
1. Go to **ElevenNote.Web -> App_Start -> RouteConfig.cs**.
2. Have a look at `routes.MapRoute()`
```csharp
routes.MapRoute(
    name: "Default",
    url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
    defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
);
```
3. `url:` is what builds out the Url we see on the webpage.
    * `{controller}` is the particular controller we are using. For this project, chances are it will be **Note**.
    * `{action}` is the **ActionResult** we are calling on (Create, Details, Edit, or Delete).
    * `{id}` is an optional parameter that will only be used when we are working with a specific note. We'll add the `NoteId` to the end of the Url in these cases.
4. The default parameter is currently set to open the application on the **Home** page.

[Next,](../9-NoteEdit/9.0-NoteEdit.md) we'll work on `NoteEdit`
