# 8.1: DETAIL VIEW
---
### Create the Detail View
In order to physically see the `NoteDetail` model on our webpage, we need to create a view for it.
1. Open `NoteController.cs`
2. The error is gone since we added the `GetNoteById()` method in `NoteService.cs`
3. Right click on the `Details()` method and add a view
4. Fill it out like this:
![Details View](/assets/8.1-A.png)

### ActionLinks
1. In the `Details.cshtml` file that was created, change the `ActionLink`s at the bottom to:

    ```html
    </div>
        <p>
            @Html.ActionLink("Edit", "Edit", new { id = Model.NoteId }) |
            @Html.ActionLink("Back to List", "Index")
        </p>
    ```
3. ![Save](/assets/font-awesome-save.png)
4. Go to **Views -> Notes -> Index.cshtml**
5. Change the `ActionLink`s at the bottom to:

    ```html
                    </td>
                <td>
                    @Html.ActionLink("Edit", "Edit", new { id=item.NoteId }) |
                    @Html.ActionLink("Details", "Details", new { id=item.NoteId }) |
                    @Html.ActionLink("Delete", "Delete", new { id=item.NoteId })
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
    ```
4. ![Save](/assets/font-awesome-save.png) & ![Git](/assets/devicons_github_badge.png)
5. These anonymous classes inside the `ActionResult` will communicate to the `NoteController` and select the appropriate Note.
6. Run the app and go to the details view on one of the notes:
![Details](/assets/8.1-B.png)
