#6.3: Interface Implementation
---
In this module we'll implement the interface in a `NoteService` class.

<hr />

### Purpose
Here, we'll use the interface to form a contract with our service. It will require the service to implement the full crud methods that we fleshed out in the INote.cs interface. Now, let's implement that contact.

### Set up the NoteService
1. Right click on the `ElevenNote.Services` assembly.
2. Click **Add** -> **Class**.
3. Name the class `NoteService`.
4. Make it public immediately.

### Implement the interface
1. In the NoteService, go ahead and implement INote:

2. Ctrl period on the interface name and bring in the using statement.

3. Ctrl period again on the interface name and that will bring in all the method implementation starter code:
